<b>How the Web Works</b>

<p>The web is a series a computers that talk to each other over the network called the internet.When a person visits a website, they are entering a
  <em>HTTP request</em> to a network or servers.

The servers find the web adress and send it back to the user where their <em>web browser</em>
shows the page on their computers.So for example if i wanted to link to <a href="https://www.att.com">ATT.com</a> I would do it like it is shown here. 
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This is a good video explaining this.</a>
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents are what you see on most on your browser. They can have <em>text content</em>
  which describes ""what you see" and <em>markup</em>
  which describes "how it looks".

</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents contain HTML elements and we tell the browser which element to use by using tags. We use tags to make things <b>bold</b> or to add <em>italics</em>
We can also use tags to insert breaks or to format the page on how we want it to look. HTML 5.0 is the language that the web is programmed in today.   
</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they are only programmed to do what humans tell them to do.
  This also makes them hard to work with because you have to be very careful about your syntax and go back and debug if you want your software to work correctly.
</p>

<b>Inline VS Block Elements</b>

<p>HTML Elements can be <b>Inline</b> or <b>block.</b> Block elements form an invisible box around the data inside of them. Inline does not.</p>
